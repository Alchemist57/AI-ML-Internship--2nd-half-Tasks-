# Task 4: Context-Aware Chatbot Using LangChain or RAG

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The objective of this task is to build a **context-aware conversational chatbot** that can maintain **conversation history** and retrieve **relevant external information** during interactions.  
The chatbot leverages **LangChain** or **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to provide accurate, context-sensitive responses.

---

## ðŸ”§ Methodology / Approach
1. **Dataset / Knowledge Base**
   - Custom corpus such as **Wikipedia pages, internal documents, or knowledge bases**.
   - Documents are **preprocessed, chunked, and embedded** for retrieval.

2. **Vector Store Creation**
   - Convert documents into **dense vector embeddings** using models like `sentence-transformers` or OpenAI embeddings.
   - Store embeddings in a **vector database** (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Chroma).

3. **Context Memory**
   - Implement **conversation memory** to preserve chat history.
   - Allow the chatbot to reference past turns for context-aware responses.

4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - At each query:
     - Retrieve relevant chunks from the vector store.
     - Pass retrieved knowledge + conversation context to the **LLM**.
   - Generate a **factually grounded and context-aware** response.

5. **Deployment**
   - Build a **Streamlit interface** for user interaction.
   - Support conversational input/output with real-time retrieval.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results / Observations
- **Context Awareness**: The chatbot maintained conversation flow by referencing past interactions.
- **Accurate Retrieval**: Vector search significantly improved response relevance by grounding answers in external knowledge.
- **LLM Integration**: Combining retrieval with a large language model (RAG) reduced hallucinations and improved factual accuracy.
- **Deployment**: The Streamlit interface provided an intuitive and interactive way to test and use the chatbot.

## ðŸš€ Skills Gained
- Designing **context-aware conversational AI** systems.
- Implementing **document embedding and vector search** for information retrieval.
- Applying **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enhance LLM accuracy.
- Integrating **LangChain pipelines** with external knowledge sources.
- Deploying AI applications using **Streamlit** for real-world usability.
