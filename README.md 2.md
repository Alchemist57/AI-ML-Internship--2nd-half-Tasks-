## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task is to build a **reusable and production-ready machine learning pipeline** for predicting **customer churn** using the **Telco Churn Dataset**.  
The pipeline should integrate **data preprocessing**, **model training**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **model export**, ensuring that it can be deployed seamlessly in real-world applications.

## ðŸ”§ Methodology / Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing with Pipeline**
   - Handle missing values and categorical encoding.
   - Apply **OneHotEncoder** for categorical features.
   - Apply **StandardScaler** for numerical features.
   - Combine transformations using **ColumnTransformer** inside a `Pipeline`.

2. **Model Training**
   - Train **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** classifiers.
   - Encapsulate preprocessing + model training into a **single pipeline** for consistency.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Use **GridSearchCV** for systematic hyperparameter optimization.
   - Evaluate model performance with cross-validation.

4. **Model Export**
   - Save the best performing pipeline using **joblib**.
   - Ensure the pipeline includes preprocessing steps, making it ready for production use without manual feature engineering.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results / Observations
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: Encapsulating preprocessing + training ensured consistent handling of data during both training and inference.
- **Best Model**: Random Forest achieved higher predictive performance compared to Logistic Regression on churn prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV improved model accuracy and reduced overfitting by finding optimal parameters.
- **Reusability**: Exported pipeline (`.joblib`) can be directly loaded and used for predictions on new data without retraining or reapplying preprocessing steps.
- **Production Readiness**: The end-to-end pipeline design ensures scalability and deployment feasibility in real-world scenarios.
