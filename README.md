This repository contains the implementation of projects completed during the 2nd half of my internship at DevelopersHub Corporation.
The tasks cover a range of machine learning and AI development practices, focusing on building production-ready pipelines, multimodal models, and intelligent applications.

âœ… Included Tasks

Task 2: End-to-End ML Pipeline with Scikit-learn (Customer Churn Prediction)

Task 3: Multimodal ML for Housing Price Prediction (Images + Tabular Data)

Task 4: Context-Aware Chatbot using LangChain / RAG

ðŸš€ Key Skills Demonstrated

Machine Learning pipeline design and deployment

Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization

Multimodal deep learning (CNNs + structured data fusion)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and conversational AI

End-to-end deployment with tools like Streamlit
